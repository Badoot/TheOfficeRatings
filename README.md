# TheOfficeRatings
Plotting viewer ratings for all 9 seasons of The Office (US)

Learning Python and Matplotlib by trying to replicate the ratings graphic on the bottom of the Wikipedia page here:

Running 'theoffice.py' will:

1. Pull episode info from Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)_episodes

2. Put the data in a Pandas Dataframe

3. Use Matplotlib to plot the ratings by episode

Pretty colors in progress...
